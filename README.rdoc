This is a sample application using rails that performs webscraping on the news.google.com domain to fetch the top news articles together with their urls to provide a cusom news aggregator. It uses nokogiri to parse the contents of the page. Specifically, the '.esc-lead-article-title' class that contains the lead title of the news.
It also saves the information into the database for fetching the information in future and also provides the saved news articles directly from another path.
It is deployed on heroku and can be accessed via:

http://google-news-parser.herokuapp.com/
the older news which are saved in the database is present as:
http://google-news-parser.herokuapp.com/news_reader/oldnews
